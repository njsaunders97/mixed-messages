# Mixed Messages 
## What is the Mixed Messages project?
We're tasked with making a random message generator. MVP is a function which uses a mix of templating and randomisation to return randomised messages to the user.
This iteration will focus on motivational messages for my friends.
## How will the project be planned?
The project will follow the kanban board <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-building-interactive-websites/tracks/fscj-22-portfolio-project-javascript-syntax/modules/fscp-22-mixed-messages-0a2e7c49-03e1-4825-a480-508f02de0208/kanban_projects/mixed-messages">list of tasks set out by Codecademy</a>, with some possible additions:
+ A live website housing the main JavaScript function
+ User-login customisation (perhaps just 'enter name' and return it)
+ Some straightforward HTML/CSS customisation
